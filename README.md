# Todo App - Agentic AI Challenge

A modern Todo application built following a **complete agentic AI workflow**: Plan → Build → Test.

## 🤖 Agentic Development Workflow

This project demonstrates authentic AI-assisted development using:

### 1. Agentic Structure
- **`.claude/commands/`** - Custom slash commands for feature development
- **`specs/`** - Detailed planning documents for each feature (PLAN phase)
- **`tests/`** - Comprehensive test suites (TEST phase)

### 2. Development Cycle

For each feature:

```
1. PLAN  → Create specification in specs/
           Document requirements, approach, and acceptance criteria

2. BUILD → Implement feature according to spec
           Follow Next.js and TypeScript best practices

3. TEST  → Write and execute tests
           Verify functionality meets requirements
```

### 3. Git Workflow

Every commit demonstrates the agentic workflow:
- Co-authored with Claude Code
- Links to planning documents
- References GitHub issues
- Includes test results

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 📋 Project Status

This project is being built incrementally through GitHub Issues, each following the Plan → Build → Test cycle.

### Completed Features
(Will be updated as features are completed)

## 🔗 Links

- **Live App**: Will be deployed on Vercel
- **Repository**: https://github.com/cjigal53/agentic_ai_challenge
- **Issues**: Track development progress through GitHub Issues

## 📚 Agentic Workflow Documentation

Each feature in this project has:
1. A GitHub Issue describing the requirement
2. A spec document in `specs/` with detailed planning
3. Implementation code in the appropriate directory
4. Tests verifying the functionality
5. Git commits showing the agentic process

This demonstrates true human-AI collaboration where:
- **Human**: Defines problems and requirements
- **AI (Claude Code)**: Plans solutions, implements, and tests
- **Result**: High-quality, tested, documented code
