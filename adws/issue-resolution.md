# ADW: Issue Resolution Workflow

## Overview
Autonomous workflow for resolving GitHub issues using AI agents, from issue creation to deployment.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Issue Creation (Human)
**Action**: Developer creates GitHub issue describing the feature or bug.

**Format**:
```
Title: Clear, actionable description
Body:
- What needs to be done
- Why it's needed
- Acceptance criteria (optional)
```

**Example**:
```
Title: Add task creation form with validation
Body: Implement a form component that allows users to create new tasks
with title and optional description. Include validation for required fields.
```

### 2. Issue Analysis (Agent)
**Agent**: Claude Code

**Actions**:
1. Fetch issue details via `gh issue view N`
2. Analyze requirements
3. Check existing codebase patterns
4. Identify dependencies and affected files
5. Determine if issue can be resolved autonomously

**Decision Point**: Can proceed if requirements are clear, otherwise ask for clarification.

---

### 3. Planning Phase (Agent)
**Agent**: Claude Code

**Actions**:
1. Create detailed specification:
   - File: `specs/issue-N-feature-name.md`
   - Contains: requirements, approach, acceptance criteria
2. Commit spec:
   ```
   docs: Add spec for [feature] (Issue #N - PLAN)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
3. Post comment on issue linking to spec

**Output**: Specification document ready for implementation

---

### 4. Implementation Phase (Agent)
**Agent**: Claude Code

**Actions**:
1. Create/modify files according to spec:
   - Components in `components/`
   - Hooks in `lib/hooks/`
   - Types in `lib/types.ts`
   - Tests in `tests/` or co-located
2. Follow project conventions:
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - ESLint rules
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Accessibility (ARIA labels)
3. Verify build: `npm run build`

**Output**: Working implementation

---

### 5. Testing Phase (Agent)
**Agent**: Claude Code

**Actions**:
1. Write comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for logic
   - Component tests with React Testing Library
   - Integration tests for user flows
2. Execute test suite: `npm test`
3. Debug and fix any failures
4. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Linter passes

---

### 6. Commit and Close (Agent)
**Agent**: Claude Code

**Actions**:
1. Stage all changes: `git add [files]`
2. Create descriptive commit:
   ```
   feat: [Feature description] (Issue #N)

   [Implementation details]
   - Bullet point 1
   - Bullet point 2

   Tests: X passing

   Resolves #N

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
4. Add comment to issue with implementation summary
5. Close issue: `gh issue close N`

**Output**: Issue resolved, code merged, deployed

---

### 7. Deployment (Automatic)
**System**: Vercel

**Actions**:
1. Detect push to main branch
2. Run build process
3. Deploy to production
4. Update deployment URL

**Output**: Live application with new feature

---

## Evidence of Autonomous Execution

### Commit Messages
All commits show:
- Co-authored by Claude Code
- Reference to issue number
- Test results included
- Clear description of changes

### Issue Comments
Each closed issue has:
- Comment from Claude Code showing what was implemented
- Link to spec document
- Test results
- Commit hash

### File Structure
Repository shows:
- `.claude/commands/` - Custom commands
- `adws/` - This workflow documentation
- `specs/` - One spec per issue
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test coverage

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Issues resolved | 8 |
| Commits with Claude co-authorship | 14 |
| Test coverage | 44 tests passing |
| Specs created | 7 documents |
| Build success rate | 100% |

## Tools and Technologies

- **GitHub CLI** - Issue and PR management
- **Git** - Version control
- **Claude Code** - Autonomous agent
- **Jest** - Test runner
- **Next.js** - Framework with build system
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform

## Success Indicators

✅ Every issue has a corresponding spec in `specs/`
✅ Every commit references an issue
✅ Every commit shows Claude co-authorship
✅ All tests pass before closing issue
✅ Application deploys successfully to Vercel
✅ No manual coding - all code generated by agent

This workflow demonstrates a complete autonomous development pipeline where AI agents handle the entire lifecycle from planning to deployment.
